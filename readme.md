## ‚ÑπÔ∏è (Note)

- To use reels forwarding, you need to have your own webhooks verified through the Instagram Graph API. If you are not familiar with it, you can contact me for assistance.

  Currently, this bot sends reels to `TELEGRAM_REELS_CHANNEL_USERNAME` telegram channel  . As I do not have a business-approved account, I can only access reels shared to Instagram accounts added to my Meta app.

  For demonstration you can send your reels to my instagram account [@alpha_engineerz](https://instagram.com/alpha_engineerz) to see the reels in the telegram channel.
  Please make sure to provide the link along with the video with meta tags.

  e.g ‚ñ∫ 

  send a reel with this text content

  reel link , some tags seperated by command for that reel.
- Make sure to install ffmpeg separately from the internet as it is not available in npm
- You can login using bot as well as user account
- You have to join the TELEGRAM_REELS_CHANNEL_USERNAME channel using bot/user account to forward reels to that channel.
